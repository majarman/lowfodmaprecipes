[recipe link](https://www.monashfodmap.com/recipe/atlantic-salmon-thick-cut-potato-chips/)

## ingredients
- 4 Atlantic salmon fillets (from the body of the fish not the tail, buy with skin on to reduce the cost), scored twice on the skin side in the thickest part of the fish.
- Fresh lemons as required for basting.
- Salt, to taste
- 8 small kipfler potatoes
- Olive oil to drizzle
- Salt, to taste
- Paprika or mixed fresh herbs to taste, optional 

## directions
1. Wash the potatoes very well removing any soil.
1. Boil the potatoes for 20 minutes in salty water over the stove.
1. Preheat the oven to 220째C/428째F or 200째C/392째F if fan forced.
1. Remove the potatoes from the boiling water and leave to cool for a few minutes. Peel (optional) and slice the potatoes into ~ 6 chip slices.
1. With a fork scrape along all the sides of the potatoes to roughen up the sides. This will allow the oil and salt to go into the crevasses for extra flavour and help crisp the chip.
1. Drizzle olive oil over the potatoes and sprinkle with sea salt. Now you can also add in your fresh herbs or sprinkle paprika if you choose. Toss to coat the potatoes.
1. Place the potatoes on a tray lined with baking paper and cook in the oven for 20-30 minutes. Meanwhile, BBQ the salmon. 
1. Heat BBQ to high setting and preferably use a grill not a plate.
1. Place fish on BBQ skin side down. Add salt, butter, squeeze of lemon and herbs/spices. 
1. Grill salmon for 10-15 min, turning the fish about halfway through cooking and adding extra butter, lemon and herbs and spices as desired.
